The carboxylic acid group is ionizable at physiological pH, making it negatively charged\n2. Charged molecules generally do NOT cross the blood-brain barrier well\n3. The molecule is relatively small but polar due to the acid group\n\nClofibric acid is a polar, ionized molecule at physiological pH and does not significantly penetrate the blood-brain barrier.\n\n**no**",
